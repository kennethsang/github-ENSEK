# Test Approach: Agile & Iterative, perform testing in short sprints, with continuous feedback loops.

As an agile tester testing a webpage platform with Register, Login, Buy, Sell features, and information display, the test approach should align with Agile principles (flexibility, collaboration, and continuous feedback). 

In Agile, formal test plans are often replaced by lightweight, adaptable plans. Focus on creating user stories, test charters, and defining acceptance criteria.

# Test deliverables
As per the exercise requirements, I need to clearly outline what I will be testing and execute at least one test case. Therefore, I will create a list of Agile Test Cases **(Doc 01 Test Suite)** rather than conducting an Exploratory Test Charter (ETC). Additionally, a **JSON file** will be used for the API test, and issues will be recorded in **Doc 03**.
